# Stock-Price-Predictor
In this personal project, I have created Machine Learning models to predict the movement of S&P500 using historical data with the support of other stock markets' historical data.
The direction of the project goes as follows:
1) Extract and Clean the data from Yahoo Finance
2) Feature Engineering with Dimensionality Reduction
3) Train with Classification Algorithms
4) Train with Optimized Classification Algorithms with GridSearch using TimeSeriesSplit for cross validation
